# Learning a bit about Branding

In the name of Allah, the most beneficent, the most merciful

----

My Lord! Open my heart, and make my task easy for me, loosen the knot in my tongue, so that they may understand my speech.

O Allah, I ask You for beneficial knowledge, goodly provision, and acceptable deeds.

## Current focus

Alhamdulillah, we were able to succesffully complete the last week's activity. Though, it took 3 extra days because we planned a trip to Lahore to meet our family.

In this week, we will be exploring what branding means? How to set a direction for ourselves and build a narrative to show case it. 

Also, If Allah wills, we will try to explore how to keep it aligned with Islamic values to the best of our abilities.

## Some notes of the activities
- Wife and kids tried to read and understand the content. They tried a couple of times. But kind of gave up because they were not able to fully grasp the concepts.
Hence, kids just used them to add some words to their vocabulary list

- Father gave them a brief overview a couple of times in-between.

- Then we had a long brainstorming session as a whole family. We tried to document mission and vission for OKC. For that we explored the mission and vission of a couple of schools
Through detailed discussions we came up with a few key points.


- We then had a couple of more collective sessions. This time the focus was to document our thoughts. Hence we used whiteboard of Canva to document it. We went through previous notes, thought a bit more about it. and Then we came up with a mission statement and few key words for theme inspiration

## A few week delay
We then ended up with a few weeks pause to the activity due to eid, travels, shifting and other breaks that came after each other.

## Outcome

At the end we came up with the following document
- [OKC - Mission and Theme Brainstorming.pdf](./OKC%20-%20Mission%20and%20Theme%20Brainstorming.pdf)
