# Learning a bit about Branding

In the name of Allah, the most beneficent, the most merciful

----

My Lord! Open my heart, and make my task easy for me, loosen the knot in my tongue, so that they may understand my speech.

O Allah, I ask You for beneficial knowledge, goodly provision, and acceptable deeds.

## Current focus

Alhamdulillah, we were able to succesffully complete the last week's activity. Though, it took 3 extra days because we planned a trip to Lahore to meet our family.

In this week, we will be exploring what branding means? How to set a direction for ourselves and build a narrative to show case it. 

Also, If Allah wills, we will try to explore how to keep it aligned with Islamic values to the best of our abilities.
